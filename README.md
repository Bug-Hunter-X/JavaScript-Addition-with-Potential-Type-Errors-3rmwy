# JavaScript Addition with Potential Type Errors

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to type handling during addition. The `foo` function adds two values but doesn't explicitly check their types before performing the addition. This can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if the inputs are not numbers.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that includes robust type checking to prevent these issues.
